# Description
* DESOLATION tells the story of a 23-year-old worker named Aiden Williams, waking up from a long hibernation in an **outpost** located on a **resource-rich asteroid**. The outpost, which was **abandoned** 50 years ago, is not safe anymore, as the robots' mechanisms were fried by the Sun, thus being **hostile** to Aiden. Through various threats like robots and obstacles, Aiden has to make his way to a launchpad to **escape the outpost**, all while questioning **why** he "woke up" in the first place. Many relevations await the one who is awake.
* Besides the story, DESOLATION also offers **two extra game modes** to play: _Infinite_ and _Playground_. Infinite mode is all about surviving as long as possible while fighting waves of enemies, and Playground mode lets the player do whatever they want using the materials given and with console commands.
* **As of 22/07/2025, the story's first chapter is in development.** For the time being, it is unclear when the chapter is going to be complete - and if so, shared to the public. **This repository might also go private in the future due to licenses.**

# Installation
* DESOLATION is **free**. <sup><sub>(at least for the time being, I might want to sell it when it's complete)</sub></sup>
* It is available for download in [GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/desolation/890404), [Itch.io](https://polaritynord.itch.io/desolation/) and [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/polaritynord/desolation/releases/latest). You can download the game from the website of your choice.
* For playing in an operating system different than Windows, you can use the **.love** file. Visit the https://love2d.org/ website to download the Love2D framework to your system and run the file with the **.love** extension.
* For the ones that want to clone the source code, I recommend downloading a release instead if you do not intend on viewing/changing the code, as it may be unstable.
