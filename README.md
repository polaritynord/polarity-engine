# ⚠️ STILL UNUSABLE. AS OF 19 NOV 2025, I AM BUSY CLEARING ALL FILES RELATED TO DESOLATION, AND ISOLATING THE ENGINE CODE ONLY.

**Polarity Engine** is built on top of Lua/Love2D, and is designed to make 2D games with ease using its built-in features such as Scenes, Particles, UI, Components and Objects.

It is, as of now, primarily being used and updated through the project [DESOLATION](https://github.com/polaritynord/desolation). This repository, once it is fully prepared of course, will be updated every now and then to catch up with DESOLATION's updated form of it, so if you want, you can also clone DESOLATION and use the engine there as well.

More documentation on the engine will be written later. My first job is to make this thing independent from DESOLATION.
