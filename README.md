# Polarity Engine

**Polarity Engine** is built on top of Lua/Love2D, and is designed to make 2D games with ease using its built-in features such as Scenes, Particles, UI, Components and Objects.

It is, as of now, primarily being used and updated through the project [DESOLATION](https://github.com/polaritynord/desolation). This repository, once it is fully prepared of course, will be updated every now and then to catch up with DESOLATION's updated form of it, so if you want, you can also clone DESOLATION and use the engine there as well.

Documentation on the engine's usage and features will be written later.
